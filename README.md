# CareComm Flutter Project

## Description

This is a Flutter project for the **CareComm** app, which features a favorites system where users can add and remove products from their favorites list. It uses the **Flutter BLoC** for state management and **SharedPreferences** for persisting the favorite products.

The app is built with the following main components:

- **ProductCubit**: Manages the state of the favorite products.
- **FavoritesScreen**: Displays the list of favorite products.

This project demonstrates state management with Flutter using BLoC and persistence with SharedPreferences.

BLoC Overview
The app uses the BLoC pattern to manage the state.

ProductCubit
The ProductCubit is responsible for loading, adding, and removing products from the favorites list. It communicates with SharedPreferences to persist the data.

ProductState
The states that ProductState can emit include:

ProductInitial: The initial state before data is loaded.
ProductLoaded: The state when the data has been successfully loaded.
ProductError: The state in which an error occurs while loading or modifying favorites.
ProductScreen
This screen uses BlocBuilder to listen for changes in the ProductCubit state. It updates the UI to display the list of favorite products or an error message.
